# KPR — Modern Time & Attendance Platform

> KPR is a cloud-based workforce management platform for GPS-verified time tracking, automated labor law compliance, payroll integration, and employee engagement.

## Product Overview

KPR replaces legacy time and attendance systems (badge swipes, biometric scanners, manual timesheets) with a modern, mobile-first platform. Employees clock in with one tap using GPS verification. Admins get real-time visibility, compliance monitoring, and one-click payroll export.

## Core Features

- **GPS Clock-In/Out**: One-tap attendance verified by GPS coordinates against configured geofence zones. Works offline and syncs automatically.
- **Compliance Engine**: Multi-jurisdiction labor law compliance including California meal/rest breaks, Oregon predictive scheduling, and federal overtime rules. Automatically enforced by location.
- **Payroll Integration**: Export time entries to Gusto, ADP, Paychex, QuickBooks, or CSV. Configurable pay code mapping, rounding rules, and overtime thresholds.
- **Team Analytics**: Real-time dashboards for punctuality trends, attendance patterns, overtime analysis, and burnout monitoring.
- **AI Scheduling**: Auto-generate fair schedules based on employee availability, skills, and labor rules.
- **Gamification**: XP, badges, streaks, and challenges that turn punctuality into engagement. Teams see 23% average attendance improvement.
- **Timesheet Approval**: Weekly submission and approval workflow with audit trail.
- **Entry Corrections**: Employee-initiated corrections with smart auto-approval and full audit log.
